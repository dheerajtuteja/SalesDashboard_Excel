__Background (Problem Statement):__


```
Imagine a premium TV brand trying to set up an internal "Team Performance Dashboard" of their institutional sales team (B2B).
Assume we are having a one-month sales dashboard. (Premium TV SOLD in a month). 
First KPI - Sales Value in Million DKK by Team (Upper part of the report).
There are Sales Qty Targets & Sales Value Targets designed by the organization for each team.
Thumbs Up chart signifies -  Sales Qty - Target vs Achievement of TV Sales.
Gauge Chart or Speedometer signifies -  -  Sales Value - Target vs Achievement of TV Sales.
Since this team is an Institutional Sales or Enterprise Sales (B2B), management is interested in "Sales Funnel" showcasing - Meetings Booked, Meetings Held & Sales Conversion of each team.
Lastly, there is a drop down that has team names to choose from. All KPIs will be highlighted/changed on the basis team chosen from the drop down.
